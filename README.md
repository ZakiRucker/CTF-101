## What is a CTF?
A CTF is a competition to practice the knowledge and skills required within various cybersecurity disciplines. Some people participate to learn skills to advance their careers, others do it as a hobby.

## Types of CTF
There are various types of CTFs. 
* Jeopardy style is a collection of trivia style questions to test basic knowledge about cybersecurity topics.
